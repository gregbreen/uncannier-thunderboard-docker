# Uncannier Thunderboard Docker

Silicon Lab's Simplicity Studio, with Gecko SDK Suite, containerized for headless builds of Blue Gecko SoC projects.

This image was specifically created for continuous integration of the following two projects:

https://github.com/gregbreen/uncannier-thunderboard-react
https://github.com/gregbreen/uncannier-thunderboard-sense2

However, it should work for any Blue Gecko SoC project so long as the Gecko SDK Suite is the right version.
